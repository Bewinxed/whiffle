/**
 * Builds the one thing a user installs.
 *
 * Whiffle is a bun workspace: six packages that import each other by name and
 * run straight from TypeScript. That is a fine way to develop and an
 * impossible way to publish — `@whiffle/agent`, `hub`, `core`, `auth` and
 * `sessiond` are all `private`, and the CLI's `bin` points at a `.ts` file that
 * only Bun can execute.
 *
 * So the workspace is bundled INTO the CLI rather than published beside it.
 * A user installs `whiffle` and gets one dependency, not six that have to be
 * version-matched with each other on every release. Real npm dependencies stay
 * external and are resolved normally by whoever installs — bundling
 * `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` or drizzle's native bindings would be
 * copying somebody else's package into ours and inheriting the maintenance.
 *
 * The dashboard ships as adapter-node's build output plus the server that
 * carries the hub's websocket through it (`serve.js`), because the board
 * without its socket is a page that loads and never connects.
