 * that loses its hub still has a policy.
 *

 *  1. The spawn path in `claude.ts`, which passes it as `disallowedTools`.
 *  2. `convergeDeniedTools`, which writes it into `~/.claude/settings.json`
 *     so the user's own `claude` sees the same denials.
 *
 * Both call {@link resolvedDenyList} — the single source — so they cannot
 * drift from each other.
