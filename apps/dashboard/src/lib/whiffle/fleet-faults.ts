/**
 * Every way the fleet can be broken, in one vocabulary.
 *
 * This file exists because of one badge. A sync failed on a MacBook and the
 * dashboard showed a single string — `error: unknown option '--scope'` — and
 * that string was hiding three separate faults: a stale `claude` binary
 * shadowing a newer one on the same machine, a `gh` with dead tokens making the
 * CLI fall back to ssh for a public repository, and whole sections of the
 * machine's report being dropped in transit so hook and memory failures were
 * invisible fleet-wide. None of that was legible without a terminal.
 *
 * So faults are modelled rather than printed. Two things follow:
 *
 *  - A fault has an ORIGIN. A row the hub could not fetch (`FleetSkillMeta.error`,
 *    `FleetPlugin.error`) never reached any machine and is fixed at the hub; a
 *    row a machine would not apply (`FleetItemState.state === 'failed'`) reached
 *    it and was refused there. They look alike in a log and have nothing in
 *    common as problems, so they never share a badge here.
 *  - A fault has a CAUSE, read off what the machine or the hub actually said.
 *    Every pattern below is matched against a string this repository is known to
 *    produce; the producer is named in each case's comment. Anything unmatched
 *    keeps its raw text and says so, rather than being guessed at.
