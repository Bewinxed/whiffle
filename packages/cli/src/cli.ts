const HELP = `whiffle ${CLI_VERSION} — join this machine to a whiffle fleet

Usage
  whiffle up [--hub <url>] [--verbose]      run the agent daemon on this machine
  whiffle hub [--verbose]                   run the hub here
  whiffle status [--hub <url>] [--verbose]  print the hub it found, and the fleet
  whiffle service <${SERVICE_ACTIONS.join("|")}> [service...]
                                            run whiffle as per-user services
  whiffle update [--check] [--to <version>] install the newest release and restart
  whiffle deploy init [--origin <url>]      developer mode: run from a git clone
  whiffle login [--token <token>]           give this machine a Claude Code token
  whiffle logout                            forget it

Services
  ${SERVICE_IDS.join(", ")} — each its own per-user service, started by systemd or
  launchd and kept up across reboots. \`install\`, \`uninstall\`, \`restart\` and
  \`status\` take any of them and act on all three when given none; \`logs\` takes
  exactly one. A machine nobody points a browser at wants \`agent\` alone.

  \`install --dev\` runs them out of the checkout instead of the build: the hub
  watches its own source and restarts itself on every edit, which costs nothing
  because the sessions live in the daemons and reconnect; the dashboard runs
  vite, which reloads an edited file without restarting at all. The agent is
  never watched in either mode — it hosts your sessions, and a restart ends
  whatever turn is in flight. \`status\` reads the mode back out of the unit.

  \`restart agent\` is therefore always deliberate: it asks the hub how many of
  this machine's sessions are mid-turn and refuses while any are. \`--when-idle\`
  waits up to five minutes for those turns to finish and then restarts; \`--force\`
  restarts regardless, and is also the only way through when the hub cannot be
  reached to answer the question at all.

Deploying
  \`whiffle deploy init\` clones ${DEPLOY_BRANCH} into ${deployRoot()} — a checkout
  that is nobody's working copy — installs it, builds the dashboard, writes a
  ${DEPLOY_MARKER} marker and installs the services pointing at that clone
  instead of at your editor's checkout. From then on the daemon fetches
  ${DEPLOY_BRANCH} every minute and, when the clone is strictly behind, pulls
  \`--ff-only\`, reinstalls, rebuilds and restarts. Pushing to ${DEPLOY_BRANCH} is
  the fleet deploy.

  The marker is the whole safety story: a checkout without one is never fetched
  and never pulled, so a dev tree cannot auto-update no matter what is running
  in it. A clone that has diverged from origin refuses loudly and is left
  exactly as it is — resetting it would destroy work nobody else has a copy of.

Options
  --hub <url>     hub to use, as http://host:port or ws://host:port/ws
  --token <token> a \`claude setup-token\` token, for \`login\` without a terminal
  --dev           for \`service install\`: run from the checkout, watching it
  --check         for \`update\`: say what is available, install nothing
  --to <version>  for \`update\`: a named release instead of the newest
  --origin <url>  for \`deploy init\`: the remote to clone (default this one's)
  --when-idle     for \`service restart\`: wait for this machine's sessions first
  --force         for \`service restart\`: restart the agent mid-turn anyway
  --follow, -f    keep printing, for \`service logs\`
  --verbose       narrate the discovery ladder
  --help          this
  --version       print the version

Signing in
  The daemon runs Claude Code as you, so it needs the credentials you logged in
  with. Run it as a service — \`whiffle service install\` — and on macOS it
  inherits your desktop session and reads them from the login keychain, which is
  the whole fix. A daemon started over SSH cannot: the keychain refuses a process
  with no GUI session, and every turn comes back "Not logged in".

  Where that is not possible — a headless box — \`whiffle login\` mints a token
  instead, kept in ${CONFIG_PATH} at mode 0600 and exported to the daemon as
  CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN, which skips the keychain entirely.

Finding the hub, in order — the first that answers wins
  1. --hub, then ${WHIFFLE_ENV.hubUrl}
  2. the last hub that answered, remembered in ${CONFIG_PATH}
  3. mDNS on the local link (_${WHIFFLE_MDNS_TYPE}._tcp)
  4. online Tailscale peers, on ${WHIFFLE_ENV.hubPort} (default ${WHIFFLE_HUB_PORT})
  5. http://localhost:${WHIFFLE_HUB_PORT}

  Step 3 only ever sees the local link. mDNS is multicast, and multicast does
  not travel over Tailscale — a hub on the far side of a tailnet is found by
  step 4, never by step 3.

Environment
  ${WHIFFLE_ENV.hubUrl}    hub to use, same as --hub
  ${WHIFFLE_ENV.hubPort}   port the probes try (default ${WHIFFLE_HUB_PORT})
  ${WHIFFLE_ENV.noMdns}=1  stop \`whiffle hub\` advertising itself
