 * fleet have been running straight out of a dev working tree that many agent
 * sessions edit at once, so a restart deploys whatever was half-written at that
 * second, and {@link import('./update').updateCheckout} rightly refuses a dirty
 * checkout — which means the machine could never catch itself up. Meanwhile the
 * Mac's daemon ran for 21 days without ever learning that main had moved,
 * because nothing looked.
 *
 * The guard is the marker. A checkout with no `.whiffle-deploy` in it is not a
 * deployment clone, and this module will not so much as *fetch* in one, let
 * alone pull. That is deliberately the first thing every path here checks: a dev
 * tree must be structurally unable to auto-pull, and "we remembered to check"
