 * dashboards, so it is the one place that can read what a session said and
 * answer it. A rule is a phrase to watch for and a sentence to send back when
 * it shows up.
 *
 * The part that makes a rule stick is the acknowledgement. A nudge the model
 * can read and move past is a nudge the model will read and move past, so a
 * fired rule stays *pending* until the session calls `note_for_user` and
 * says what it did about it — the reply it receives ends by asking for exactly
 * that. While it is pending every further match fires
 * again — the rule nags. Acknowledging re-arms it, so the same rule can catch
 * the same habit later in the same session.
