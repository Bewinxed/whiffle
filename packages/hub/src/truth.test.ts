/**
 * Session liveness is the daemon's; the column is history.
 *
 * The defect this file fences, measured before it was fixed: `/api/instances`
 * reported 178 instances `running` on one machine while 42 `claude` processes
 * existed there — all of them at or under 1.5% CPU and 36–44 hours old — and
 * only two of those rows had been touched in the previous 90 minutes. Nothing
 * had gone wrong at any single moment; the hub had simply been writing
 * `running` at every spawn, respawning every resumable orphan on every daemon
 * register, and serving the resulting column back as a statement about the
 * present tense forever afterwards.
 *
 * The fix has four moving parts and this file is the statement of what each
 * one means:
 *
 * - a spawn writes `starting`, because issuing a spawn is not a process;
 * - the daemon's heartbeat is the only thing that mints `running`, and the same
 *   beat's silence is what takes it away again — with no respawn from that path;
 * - a register's recovery is bounded by a horizon and a cap, so a machine that
 *   was away for a day and a half is not handed its whole history as a work
 *   queue;
 * - and every read passes through a presence overlay, so a row on a machine the
 *   hub is not holding a socket for is served `unknown` rather than whatever it
 *   last said.
 *
 * A scratch database, for the reason every other suite here keeps one: `bun
 * test` runs every file in one process, so a shared path is a shared race.
