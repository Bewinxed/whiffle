/**
 * Lookbehind, patched out of the dependencies that would compile it.
 *
 * Safari grew regex lookbehind in 16.4, and this dashboard is opened on an
 * iPad running iPadOS 15.6. A lookbehind reaching that engine is not a
 * degraded feature, it is a `SyntaxError: invalid group specifier name`
 * thrown while the module is still evaluating — so the chunk never finishes,
 * and whichever route imported it renders SvelteKit's "500 — Internal Error"
 * while the rest of the app carries on working. That is how this started:
 * one screen down, everything else fine.
 *
 * Each entry names the module it applies to and the exact text it swaps. The
 * build FAILS when a listed module contains neither the text to replace nor
 * the replacement — an upgrade that respells the code silently un-fixes the
 * iPad otherwise, and a build that stops is recoverable in a way a bug
 * reported three weeks later is not. A module already carrying the
 * replacement is fine and says nothing: bun can serve a previously patched
 * copy out of its cache, and failing on that stopped a deploy once already.

/**
 * Proxies the dashboard's `/ws` upgrade to the hub, by hand.
 *
 * Vite's built-in `server.proxy['/ws'] { ws: true }` stopped upgrading the
 * socket under rolldown-vite — the handshake returns 404/no-101 and the
 * dashboard reads the hub as unreachable even while it is up. Rather than fight
 * the proxy internals, this claims the `/ws` upgrade itself: it opens an Upgrade
 * request to the hub, replays the hub's 101 back to the browser, and pipes the
 * two raw sockets together. HMR (a different path / the `vite-hmr` protocol) is
 * never `/ws`, so returning early leaves it entirely to Vite.
 *
 * Also the whole fix for a stray upgrade killing the dev server: `http.Server`
 * drops a socket's error handling the moment it emits `upgrade`, so an upgrade
 * no listener claims is left with no `error` handler and the eventual reset is a
 * process-level throw. Attaching an error listener to every upgrade socket keeps
 * that reset from taking the server (and every dashboard socket) down with it.

   * turns `try { return !!new RegExp("(?<=1)(?<!1)") } catch { return false }`

   * grew in 16.4, so the minified bundle took the lookbehind branch and threw
   * `SyntaxError: invalid group specifier name` while the markdown chunk was
   * evaluating. Only the transcript loads that chunk, so the whole app worked
   * on an iPad except the one screen, which rendered "500 — Internal Error".

   * for marked and for anything else that detects a feature this way. Do not
   * replace this with `esnext`, and do not drop it: either brings the bug back
