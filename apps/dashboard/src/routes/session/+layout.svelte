  /**
   * The workspace surface: the fleet board, and the groups of conversations
   * arranged over it.
   *
   * What this file owns is small, deliberately. It reconciles the URL with
   * the workspace, holds the server's answer for whichever conversation the
   * page was entered with, and decides whether the reader gets a grid or a
   * single group. Everything about a group — its tabs, its identity bar, its
   * swipe — belongs to `PaneLeaf`, once per group rather than once per app.
   * That is what makes a split two workstations instead of one view showing
   * two things. The conversations themselves belong to `PaneHost`, mounted
   * once each and docked into whichever group holds them.
   *
   * The active conversation is `workspace.activeSessionId`, a plain piece of
   * state, not `page.params.id`. Showing one assigns it and re-renders in the
   * same frame; the URL is written afterwards with `pushState`, which runs no
   * load. Because no load runs, `page.data` cannot change on a switch, so the
   * server tail cannot land late and rebuild a transcript already on screen —
   * which is what the View-Transition suppression flag and the one-frame
   * animation guards used to be hiding.
