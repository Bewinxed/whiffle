   * what lets two conversations be worked in side by side. The conversations
   * themselves are not this group's to mount: `PaneHost` keeps each one
   * alive once and docks it into the slot here, so a split, a move or a
   * change of grid rearranges the DOM without rebuilding a transcript.

   * The header stays ONE instance per group on purpose. Because there is one
   * of it and its text comes from synchronous state, torph morphs the title
   * character by character when the group changes tab, instead of the bar
   * being torn down and rebuilt. Give each tab its own header and that
   * disappears.
