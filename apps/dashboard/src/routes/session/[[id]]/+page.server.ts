 * puts real transcript rows in the server's HTML — the reason the virtualiser
 * carries an SSR path at all. On anything the client asks for afterwards it is
 * dead weight: the socket already holds the conversation, and awaiting a second
 * copy of it only delayed the answer.
 *
 * It used to be awaited on both, under a comment claiming it was awaited on
 * neither. That was the layout shift: a tab switch ran this load, the tail
 * landed after the animation had finished, and the transcript rebuilt itself
 * from the slower of two identical sources. Switching conversations no longer
 * reaches this file at all — the workspace store owns that now — so this gate
