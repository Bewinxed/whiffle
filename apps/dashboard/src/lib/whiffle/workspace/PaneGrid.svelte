   * A branch is a paneforge `PaneGroup` running along one axis; a leaf is a
   * group of tabs. Nesting is the whole mechanism — a horizontal group whose
   * child is a vertical group IS an L-shaped layout, so there is no separate
   * concept of a "layout" to keep in step with the tree. What the reader
   * arranges and what gets stored are the same shape.
   *
   * Sizes are written back through `onLayoutChange` rather than left to
   * paneforge's own `autoSaveId`. Two stores for one fact drift: paneforge
   * would keep sizes under a key of its own that survives a tree mutation
   * which reshapes the group, and then apply the old numbers to new children.

   * groups either side of a split both answering it would make the gesture
   * mean "whichever one you happened to start over".
   *
   * Kept off a cursor rather than left harmless. Touch handlers on a mouse
   * never fire, so the gesture itself costs nothing there, but arming it also
   * mounts and builds the neighbouring tabs so a swipe reveals a transcript
   * instead of a blank frame (PaneLeaf). That work is worth paying for where
   * the swipe exists, and is pure waste where it cannot happen.
