// biome-ignore-all lint/performance/noAwaitInLoops: this driver is a sequencer.
// Every loop here is a scenario played in order — each one remounts the
// transcript and records it in isolation — so the awaits are the schedule, not
// a missed batching opportunity.

/**
 * ARRIVAL TRAFFIC — drive the transcript's row-arrival motion and report what
 * Chrome actually animated.
 *
 * The DevTools Animations panel, scripted. It records `Animation.animationStarted`
 * over CDP, which is what Chrome CREATED — not what a computed style happened to
 * say a frame later, and not what the source implies should have happened. That
 * distinction is the whole point: the defect this was built for (a run of tool
 * calls animating only its first call) was invisible in the source and invisible
 * in a screenshot, and obvious the moment the animations were listed.
 *
 * It drives `/motion/traffic`, which mounts the real Transcript against a
 * synthetic session, so a scenario costs a few seconds instead of a model
 * session's worth of tokens.
 *
 *   bun scripts/arrival-traffic.mjs --url=http://127.0.0.1:3000

 * Exits non-zero if the arrival contract below is broken, so it can gate a
 * change to the motion code.
