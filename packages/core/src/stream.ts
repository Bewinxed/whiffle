/**
 * The Ledger Protocol: one canonical, ordered event stream per session, and

 *
 * WHY (JOURNEY.md, cross-cutting error state): "an empty surface must assert
 * that the connection is live before it is allowed to claim zero" — and its
 * generalisation: a client must never render a guess as truth. The dashboard's
 * historical failure class (fabricated echoes, invented timestamps, banners on
 * healthy connects, seams like `absorbLive` reconciling client guesses with
 * server state) all follow from state being duplicated or inferred client-side.
 * This protocol removes the inference: the hub assigns each session a monotonic
 * sequence, clients follow it gap-free or resynchronise explicitly, and
 * commands carry ids the hub acknowledges stage by stage.
 *
 * Compatibility is capability-negotiated: a hub that speaks this advertises
 * {@link STREAM_V1}; a client that does not see it uses the legacy paths
 * unchanged. Every shape here is additive — no existing wire type changes.
