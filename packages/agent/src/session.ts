   * can be free, and a daemon that killed them on the way out spent that for
   * nothing — the deploy path restarts this process on every push to main.
   *
   * So only this daemon's bookkeeping is dropped. The procs stay where they
   * are, and the next daemon adopts them through {@link reattachFrom}, which
   * is the hand-back this detach exists to leave possible.
   *

   * down still takes its children with it. Neither is a restart.
