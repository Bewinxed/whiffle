<!--
  Text with the part the query matched marked inside it.

  A palette that only lists titles makes the reader guess why each row is
  there. Marking the match answers it in place: the row says what it is AND
  what it matched on, so a list of near-identical session names becomes
  readable at a glance.

  Ranges are `[start, end)` character offsets into `text`, resolved against
  its lowercased twin — so the marked slice is the original casing, not the
  folded one. `<mark>` is the semantic element for "text of relevance"; the
  background is cleared so it never fights the selected-row fill.
