/**
 * Toasts when a machine's daemon restarts itself to pick up a deploy.

 * Unlike {@link checkDeployToast} in `deploy-toast.ts`, there is no baseline to
 * compare against: the hub only ever sets `AgentRow.restarted` on the one
 * `instances` frame right after the event, and deletes its own record of it
 * the instant that frame is built (see `withPresence`/`restarts` in
 * `packages/hub/src/server.ts`). A row that carries it is, by construction,
 * reporting something that just happened — never something ambient the page
 * loaded into — so every sighting toasts, once, and there is nothing to
 * remember between frames.
