   * that was paid on every streamed frame: a session streaming into a tab the
   * reader is NOT looking at rebuilt every row and re-parsed the streaming
   * turn's markdown, frame after frame, forever. Measured at 1.09s of script
   * and 513 layouts per 300 streamed frames — MORE than the same stream costs
   * in the pane actually on screen, because the background session was the
   * large one. With several tabs open and one session streaming, the reader
   * pays that for a picture nobody can see.
   *
   * So an invisible transcript stops reading the session at all. While
   * `visible` is false the body below touches only `visible` and the array it
   * already built, which means nothing the session writes can invalidate it —
   * there is no recompute to skip because there is no invalidation. virtua
   * stays mounted on the rows it already has, so the DOM, the heights it
   * measured and the scroll offset are all untouched and a frozen pane costs
   * nothing per frame.
   *
   * Flipping `visible` or `focused` back on does NOT rebuild in that flush.
   * The switch used to fold every message and re-render every row inside the
   * same task as the tab change — the dock's `appendChild`, the scroll
   * restore and a 256ms fold, all before the first paint — which is the
   * delay the reader felt as the tab sticking. Now the switch paints the
   * frozen rows as they are (`held`), and the catch-up runs after that paint
   * as an APPEND: the fold restarts at the last turn before the old end, so
   * every row before it keeps its identity and the keyed each touches only
   * the rows that are actually new. The tail-follow effect below then rides
   * to the new tail if the reader was at the tail when they left.
   *
   * The grid adds a third state between those two. A pane that is visible but
   * NOT focused still has to show what its agent is saying, but rebuilding it
   * on every frame of its own stream is what makes four panes cost four times
   * one. So it reads the session under `untrack` and depends on nothing but a
   * counter the scheduler bumps when this pane's turn comes round. The session
   * can write as often as it likes; only the tick invalidates this. A hidden
   * pane takes the same turns at the scheduler's slow tier, so that by the
   * time it is switched to there is usually nothing left to fold.

   * How many rows the SERVER paints — and nothing the browser ever hears about.
   *
   * `ssrCount` is virtua's server-render escape hatch: without it the store has
   * no viewport and no scroll offset to reason from, so it renders the empty
   * range `[0, -1]` and the server's HTML carries a transcript with no rows in
   * it. Handing it the row count makes the server emit exactly that many, which
   * (with the `ListItem` patch that keeps them in normal flow until mount) is
   * what puts the conversation in the first response.
   *
   * The catch is that it is not a render hint — it is a LATCH. The store reads
   * it ONCE, at construction (`createVirtualStore(data.length, itemSize,
   * ssrCount, …)`), sets `isSSR = !!ssrCount`, and pins its range at
   * `[0, ssrCount - 1]`; `$getRange` then short-circuits to that frozen pair for
   * as long as `isSSR` holds. The only thing in the whole store that clears the
   * flag is `ACTION_SCROLL_OFFSET_CHANGE` — a genuine scroll event whose offset
   * actually differs from the one on file.
   *
   * So a hydrating client that is handed `ssrCount` inherits that latch, and a
   * transcript shorter than its viewport can never shed it: there is nothing to
   * scroll, so no scroll event, so the range stays pinned at the row count the
   * page happened to hydrate with. Rows built after that — the message the
   * operator just sent, every frame the agent streams back — were folded, keyed
   * and handed to the Virtualizer correctly and then dropped on the floor by a
   * range that had stopped moving. Only a reload (a new store, a new count)
   * showed them. That is the whole "transcript does not update live" defect.
   *
   * Gating on `browser` is therefore not a micro-optimisation but the contract:
   * the count belongs to the server render, and the client builds a store that
   * measures its viewport like any other. The hydrating render draws no rows for
   * the microtask before `onMount` wires virtua's ResizeObserver to the
   * scroller; ResizeObserver notifications are delivered in the rendering step
   * BEFORE paint, so the measured range lands in the same frame and the gap is
   * never seen.
