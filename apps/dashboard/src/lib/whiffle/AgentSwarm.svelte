   * answer — how many are out, which labs they are, and which of them are
   * still moving. The marks are the row's disclosure control too, so the count
   * and the way in are one target rather than two.
   *
   * What makes it read as live is not the rings alone but what the strip does
   * around them: a spawn scales in where it lands, a landing fades its mark
   * back so the eye keeps going to whatever is still turning, and the order
   * only ever shifts under `flip`, never by jumping.
