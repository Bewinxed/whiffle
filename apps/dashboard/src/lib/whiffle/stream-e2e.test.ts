/**
 * The Ledger Protocol, end to end, in one process.
 *
 * Every other suite proves one half. This one proves the two halves COMPOSE:
 * a real `createServer` on an ephemeral port, a real daemon WebSocket feeding
 * it frames, and the dashboard store's real decision logic on the other end of
 * a real dashboard WebSocket — with the client's socket binding replicated
 * line for line from `client.svelte.ts`, because a `.svelte.ts` module cannot
 * be imported by `bun test` (which is why the decisions live in `stream.ts` at
 * all).
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL HERE
 * - `packages/hub/src/server.ts` — the whole hub, listening, over real sockets.
 * - `packages/hub/src/stream.ts` — its sequencer, its 512 ring, its acks.
 * - `packages/hub/src/db` — a real (scratch) sqlite database.
 * - `apps/dashboard/src/lib/whiffle/stream.ts` — every client-side decision:
 *   capability detection, cursors, gap/duplicate/backlog/reset handling, the
 *   command tracker.
 * - The wire: real `WebSocket`s, real JSON, the RAW top-level stream shapes.
 *
 * WHAT IS SCRIPTED HERE, AND WHY
 * - The registry (see {@link makeRegistry}) — `packages/hub/src/registry.ts`
 *   only exports its implementation through an Effect `Layer`, and `effect`
 *   does not resolve from `apps/dashboard`. The stand-in is the real one's
 *   maps with the real one's semantics.
 * - `pending` — a no-op; nothing here parks a permission request.
 * - The client's socket binding ({@link connect}) and the store chokepoint
 *   ({@link Client.ingest}) — replicated from `client.svelte.ts:1157` and
 *   `:1521`, in the same order, so the routing under test is the routing that
 *   ships. The store state they drive is the real module's.
 * - The daemon — a real socket speaking the real agent dialect, but scripted:
 *   it emits the frames a test asks for and answers controls on demand.
