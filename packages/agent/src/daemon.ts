 * rather than replacing any of it: a failure counter and its first-failure
 * timestamp live for the life of one series (the same lifetime `Schedule`'s
 * own backoff state has), incrementing on every failure regardless of how the
 * backoff or the healthy-check settle it. Once the counter and the span both
 * cross the configured threshold, `onTrigger` is awaited — inline, before the

 * starts clean. A series that ends by going healthy gets a fresh counter the
