 *
 * This lives on the agent side of the package graph, not core and not cli:
 * `@whiffle/cli` already depends on `@whiffle/agent` (it dynamically imports
 * `runDaemon` and `machineId` from here for `whiffle up`), so the reverse
 * dependency — agent importing from cli — would be a cycle. `discover.ts`
 * imports these instead of keeping its own copies of the mDNS/tailscale/probe
 * logic; its own rungs (`--hub`/env, the CLI's cached config, localhost) and
 * its user-facing `[n/5]` narration stay put, unchanged.
