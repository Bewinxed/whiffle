 * notice, a delegate's report or ask. (A rule's marker lives beside the rest
 * of rules, in `rules.ts`.)

 * it: a transcript read back off disk returns every one of these as a plain
 * user turn. The marker is the part that survives, so the hub builds it here
 * and the dashboard parses it here, and a stored copy renders exactly as the
