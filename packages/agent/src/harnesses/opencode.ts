/**
 * The opencode adapter.
 *
 * opencode is server-first: one headless server per machine owns every session,
 * and the npm SDK is a type-safe client over its HTTP + SSE surface. This
 * adapter lazily starts that server and keeps one event-stream subscription
 * PER WORKING DIRECTORY — started the first time a session spawns into that
 * directory, kept alive until the harness disposes — because opencode's event
 * stream is scoped per directory. Sessions are addressed by the server's
 * session id; a spawn either creates one, re-opens a stored id (`resume`), or
 * forks (`resume.fork` / `resume.atMessage`).
 *
 * Translation is one-directional: opencode events become {@link NeutralMessage}
 * frames the dashboard already folds. Events route to their session by session
 * id — including part-carrying events, whose id lives on the part itself
 * (`part.sessionID`). Text streams in via `properties.delta` while `part.text`
 * carries the full accumulated text, which is what the closing frame replays;
 * reasoning streams the same way as a live thinking block and settles as a
 * `thinking` block on the closing frame; tool states emit deduped
 * `tool_use`/`tool_result` frames keyed by call id. A turn's `result` frame
 * closes on `session.idle` or on `session.error` (`aborted` /
 * `error_during_execution`), so a busy session is never left hung.
