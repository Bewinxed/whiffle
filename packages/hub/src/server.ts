 * had no other source for them, and the hand-off respawned them on defaults.
 *
 * A spec is small and a machine's rows are few, so the honest scope is all of
 * them: the daemon looks up the ids it actually adopted and ignores the rest.
 * Only what a relaunch has to carry, and only where the row names it — an
