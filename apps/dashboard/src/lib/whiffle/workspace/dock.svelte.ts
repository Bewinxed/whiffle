/**
 * Conversations are mounted ONCE, by `PaneHost`, and docked into whichever
 * group holds them. A group never renders a `SessionPane`; it renders a slot
 * per tab and the host moves the pane's DOM into it.
 *
 * Every tree change used to remount. A split replaces the target leaf with
 * a branch, so both halves are new components; a move takes the conversation
 * out of one leaf's `mounted` and into another's; the phone-to-desk switch
 * swaps the whole grid. Each time the transcript rebuilt every row, virtua
 * re-measured from nothing, the scroll offset and the half-typed message were
 * gone, and for the length of that rebuild the pane was blank. Moving a DOM
 * node between parents keeps the component, its state and its measurements;
 * only the scroll offsets need carrying across, because a scrolling box is
 * destroyed with the layout box and comes back at zero.
