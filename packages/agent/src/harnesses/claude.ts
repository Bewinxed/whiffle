/**
 * The Claude Code adapter.
 *
 * The original harness — everything whiffle did before harnesses existed ran on
 * it, so this file is the quarry the other adapters are measured against. It
 * spawns `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`'s `query()`, feeds it an
 * `AsyncIterable` prompt, parks `canUseTool` under the SDK's `requestId`, and
 * translates SDK messages into the neutral spine. The translation is a re-tag:
 * the neutral types mirror the SDK's field names, so a message crosses the wire
 * with its `raw` self attached and nothing lost.

 * the verdict was still `undefined` at `head`, and the hand-off never fired:
 * the session sat in custody for good, holding every message sent to it.
 *
 * Reading from the ring's start cannot run out of window that way. It is one
 * pass over at most a few thousand retained lines, once per adopted session,
 * and only the peeked prefix is parsed — nothing below the caller's cursor is
 * re-emitted. Sessiond refusing this cursor is not a failure but the answer to

 * protocol state (§4.1, and the spike recorded in this leaf's report did not
 * overturn it). So the returning agent takes CUSTODY instead — cursor
 * arithmetic and raw control answers, nothing more:
 *
 *  - ring lines are re-derived into neutral frames through {@link toNeutral},
 *    which is already a pure function over parsed JSON and needs no `Query`;
 *  - an unanswered `control_request`/`can_use_tool` is re-parked under the
 *    SDK's own `requestId`, so the hub's parked ask stays answerable — and the
 *    answer goes back as a raw `control_response` line, because that is what
 *    the `Query` would have written anyway;
 *  - any OTHER control the CLI asks of the absent agent (an `mcp_message` for
 *    the whiffle server, a hook callback) is answered with an explicit in-band
 *    error, so the tool call FAILS VISIBLY instead of hanging forever on a
 *    handler that no longer exists;
 *  - at the turn's next `result` line the child's stdin is EOF'd and the
 *    hand-off fires: the owner respawns through the full SDK with
 *    `resume: sessionId`. The in-flight turn completed and was captured; the
 *    cost is one respawn at a turn boundary. A child that was already between
 *    turns when adopted has no next `result` coming, so {@link ClaudeHarness.adopt}
 *    fires the same hand-off from the ring's last line instead.
 *
 * Custody is a degraded mode measured in seconds, not a second implementation
 * of the SDK. Everything it refuses, it refuses out loud.

   * once, at the one moment the whole backlog has gone past: unless the ring
   * says a turn is in flight, the hand-off fires. Reading from the start is
   * what makes that a decision rather than a guess — a fixed window can fill
   * with the notices an idle child keeps writing and answer "don't know",
   * which is the shape of the bug this replaces, whereas a full ring holding
   * no turn-bearing line means the child has not taken a turn in anything
   * sessiond still remembers.
   *
   * The peek is the same subscribe opened earlier, not a second read: what
   * comes back at or below the caller's own cursor is looked at and NOT
   * re-emitted — the hub already has it, and `ingest` would hand it a frame
   * it holds. A cursor sessiond refuses is not a transcript gap and not a
   * dead end: its `reset` names the oldest line it still holds, and the peek
   * reopens there.
