/**
 * A question in opencode rides on an ordinary tool part named `question`, and
 * that part is the whole of what needs reading: opencode keeps the asked
 * questions in `state.input`, the chosen answers in `state.metadata.answers`,
 * and completes the part whether the answer came through whiffle, through
 * opencode's own TUI, or from any other client on the server. Because it is
 * stored like any other part, a reopened transcript replays it too.
 *
 * What is pinned here is that the part is renamed to the fleet's own
 * {@link ASK_USER_QUESTION} — the renderer keys off that — and that the outcome
 * is read off the part rather than off the `question.*` events, which would
 * have covered only the live case and only the routes we happened to think of.
 *
 * The shapes below are copied from a real opencode 1.18 server: a live question
 * asked, answered, and read back off `GET /session/{id}/message`.
