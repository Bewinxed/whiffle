 * The answer path for a question a delegate parked and its parent answered.

 * The parent only ever sees the question text and the labels, so its
 * `answer_delegate` sends the chosen labels alone — and an `AskUserQuestion`
 * whose `updatedInput` has lost its `questions` is refused by the SDK ("The
 * required parameter `questions` is missing"), killing the delegate's tool
 * call. The harness that parked the ask is the only side still holding the
 * input, so it puts it back: the shape the dashboard has always sent
 * (`questionAnswer` in apps/dashboard/src/lib/whiffle/question.ts).
