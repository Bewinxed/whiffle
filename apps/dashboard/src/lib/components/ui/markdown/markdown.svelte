<!-- Word-level reveal for prose. Streamdown already splits a text node into
     one span per word and animates each on mount — the same shape `Stream`
     produces for the rest of a row, so the transcript does not need two
     implementations and this file does not need to know about the row's clock.
     What it cannot do is stagger them, which `MessageBody` adds in CSS off the
     span's own position. Blur, because that is what hides the seam where a
     streamed chunk meets the text already on screen.

     `enabled` is tied to `animated` rather than left on: streamdown also
     blurs whole BLOCKS in — code, images, alerts — and that one is gated on
     nothing but its own mount, not on `static`. Left on, every code block in
     the history blurred itself in on every page load. -->

  <!-- A fence is code, and the console has one surface for code: the same well a
	     tool result opens into, painted by the same highlighter. Streamdown can
	     highlight fences itself, but it resolves one shiki theme at a time and
	     writes it as inline colours — registering a custom pair through its
	     `shikiThemes` pins every fence to whichever theme is listed first, and
	     following the appearance instead means re-tokenizing every block on every
	     switch, through a second shiki with a second cache. Ours carries both inks
	     on the token and lets CSS choose. Prose dresses every `pre` and `code` it
	     contains, so the well opts out of that dressing here; inline code
	     (`codespan`) keeps it, because it is prose, not a listing. -->
