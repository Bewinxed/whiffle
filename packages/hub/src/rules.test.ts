 * testing the stub. Only the socket is faked, because that is the one thing a
 * test cannot have.
 *
 * The path is named rather than set through `WHIFFLE_DB_PATH`. Under `bun test`
 * every file shares one process, `DB_PATH` is read once at import, and the file
 * that loses that race writes its fixtures into the fleet's real `whiffle.db` —
