/**
 * Swiping between conversations.
 *
 * The gesture is continuous: the finger drags the current pane off and the
 * neighbouring one on, both moving in lockstep, so the next conversation
 * reads as having been there all along rather than as something that
 * arrives. That only works because the panes are all mounted and the
 * workspace answers synchronously — a gesture cannot wait for a router.
 *
 * Three rules decide whether a horizontal drag belongs to the page, and all
 * three exist because of something that would otherwise break:
 *
 * - It must be mostly horizontal. A transcript scrolls vertically, and a
 *   thumb travelling down the screen must never take the page with it.
 * - It must not start on a control, in the composer, or inside something
 *   that scrolls sideways. Code blocks and tool output scroll horizontally;
 *   stealing that is worse than having no gesture at all.
 * - Ownership is settled at touchstart and never revisited. The browser
 *   cannot be told half way through a gesture that someone else wants it,
 *   so asking later would mean asking after the answer stopped mattering.
 *
 * CSS owns rest, this file owns motion — the same division as the deck's.
 * The stylesheet parks the active pane and its two neighbours by their
 * distance in the strip; while the finger holds them the handler writes a
 * translate straight onto the three, and at release the settle is
 * integrated once and handed to the compositor as keyframes. When it lands
 * the inline transforms are cleared and the parking places take over.
