/**
 * The Claude Code adapter.

 * The original harness — everything whiffle did before harnesses existed ran on
 * it, so this file is the quarry the other adapters are measured against. It
 * spawns `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`'s `query()`, feeds it an
 * `AsyncIterable` prompt, parks `canUseTool` under the SDK's `requestId`, and
 * translates SDK messages into the neutral spine. The translation is a re-tag:
 * the neutral types mirror the SDK's field names, so a message crosses the wire
 * with its `raw` self attached and nothing lost.

 * THE PEEK-LESS ADOPTION — the second boundary that never comes.

 * tail sessiond can still serve. It cannot for the two cases that leave
 * `peekSeq` undefined: a welcome carrying no usable `head`, and a peek window
 * sessiond refuses outright because the ring has already wrapped past it —
 * which is exactly what a long-lived session's ring does. Both used to fall
 * through to the turn-boundary rule, and for a child whose turn ended BEFORE
 * the agent died that boundary never arrives. The session then stayed in
 * custody for good: every message sent to it held in `#held` and never
 * delivered, every control refused, while the row still read `running`.
 *
 * The disk transcript covers precisely this middle, as the honest-loss rule
 * already says it does. The read is the same tail the dashboard's first paint
 * uses (~4ms on a 97MB file) and only the LAST assistant record is consulted:
 * one that stopped for any reason other than `tool_use` is a completed turn,
 * so the child is waiting. Everything else — a tool call still pending, no
 * assistant record in the tail, a file that cannot be found or read — returns
 * false and leaves the turn-boundary rule in charge. That asymmetry is the
 * point: a missed idle costs a session that waits for the next real `result`,
 * while a wrong "idle" would end stdin under a turn that is still running.

 * CUSTODY (design §4.1) — the session while the agent that owned it is gone.

 * A restarted agent cannot reconstruct a live `Query` around a mid-stream
 * child: the SDK offers spawn substitution, not adoption of a half-initialized
 * protocol state (§4.1, and the spike recorded in this leaf's report did not
 * overturn it). So the returning agent takes CUSTODY instead — cursor
 * arithmetic and raw control answers, nothing more:
 *
 *  - ring lines are re-derived into neutral frames through {@link toNeutral},
 *    which is already a pure function over parsed JSON and needs no `Query`;
 *  - an unanswered `control_request`/`can_use_tool` is re-parked under the
 *    SDK's own `requestId`, so the hub's parked ask stays answerable — and the
 *    answer goes back as a raw `control_response` line, because that is what
 *    the `Query` would have written anyway;
 *  - any OTHER control the CLI asks of the absent agent (an `mcp_message` for
 *    the whiffle server, a hook callback) is answered with an explicit in-band
 *    error, so the tool call FAILS VISIBLY instead of hanging forever on a
 *    handler that no longer exists;
 *  - at the turn's next `result` line the child's stdin is EOF'd and the
 *    hand-off fires: the owner respawns through the full SDK with
 *    `resume: sessionId`. The in-flight turn completed and was captured; the
 *    cost is one respawn at a turn boundary. A child that was already between
 *    turns when adopted has no next `result` coming, so {@link ClaudeHarness.adopt}
 *    fires the same hand-off from the ring's last line instead.
 *
 * Custody is a degraded mode measured in seconds, not a second implementation
 * of the SDK. Everything it refuses, it refuses out loud.
