/**
 * The harness-neutral spine (the 2026-08 rework).
 *
 * Whiffle once tunnelled Claude Agent SDK types verbatim — `@whiffle/core`
 * re-exported the SDK, the agent spawned `query()` and the dashboard folded SDK
 * messages into view state. Making the product harness-agnostic means the wire,
 * the hub and the dashboard all speak a vocabulary whiffle owns, and each
 * harness (claude, opencode, pi, …) is a daemon-side adapter that translates its
 * native events into it.
 *
 * Design rules for anything added here:
 * - This is the *only* wire contract. The dashboard folds these types, the hub
 *   peeks them, the agent adapters produce them.
 * - Field names deliberately mirror the Claude Agent SDK where a shape already
 *   exists there (it is the richest harness). That keeps the folding layer a
 *   type swap rather than a rewrite, and makes the claude adapter a re-tag.
 * - Every message carries `raw` — the harness's own event, verbatim — so a
 *   feature not yet modelled can still be reached without a protocol change.
 * - Nothing in this file imports a harness SDK. Those are agent-internal
 *   dependencies, never shared on the wire.
