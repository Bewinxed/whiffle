/**
 * The deployment clone's state, end to end across the wire (leaf Y2).
 *
 * Leaf C1 built the watcher and leaf C2 built the board's reader, and for two
 * commits neither could see the other: the watcher reported to an injectable
 * callback and the dashboard read an `AgentRow.deploy` field that did not
 * exist, so update-pending never lit up and — the part that matters — a clone
 * that had DIVERGED and was refusing to deploy said so to a log file nobody
 * reads. This file is the statement that the trip now happens, and that
 * `diverged` survives it intact.
 *
 * A scratch database, for the reason every other suite here keeps one: `bun
 * test` runs every file in one process, so a shared path is a shared race.
