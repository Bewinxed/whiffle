/**
 * ── The `ssrCount` latch ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not a `buildRows` test, but the guard that keeps `buildRows`' output visible,
 * and this is the transcript's test file. The rows folded above are handed to
 * virtua's `Virtualizer`, and for a while the transcript handed it `ssrCount`
 * unconditionally — including on the client. That looks like a hint. It is a
 * LATCH: the store reads `ssrCount` once, at construction, and pins its render
 * range at `[0, ssrCount - 1]` until a real scroll event clears the flag. A
 * transcript shorter than its viewport can never produce one, so every row
 * built after hydration — the message just sent, every streamed frame — was
 * folded correctly and then dropped by a range that had stopped moving. The
 * fix is that `ssrCount` is a SERVER-render count, gated on `browser`.
 *
 * The two tests below pin both halves: the upstream behaviour that makes the
 * gate necessary, and the gate itself. If a virtua upgrade ever drops the
 * latch, the first fails and the gate can be reconsidered on purpose rather
 * than by accident.
