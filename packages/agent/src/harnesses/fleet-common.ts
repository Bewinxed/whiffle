/**
 * Fleet file-sync primitives shared by every harness's machine profile.

 * `~/.config/opencode/skills/`, pi to `~/.pi/agent/skills/`. A skill *is* its
 * files and the memory document *is* its text, so the hash is the whole
 * economy: an unchanged skill costs one comparison however many megabytes it
 * arrived with. What whiffle wrote is named in a per-directory sidecar, and
