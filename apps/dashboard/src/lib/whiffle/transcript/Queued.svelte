   * everything a turn earns by having happened: full presence, and a clock.
   * This has neither. The chip in the clock's place says why.
   *
   * No timestamp is rendered at all, not even the time it was queued. The time
   * the reader wants from a turn is when it was said, and this has not been
   * said yet — a time here would be a promise about the wrong moment.
