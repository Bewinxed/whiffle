/**
 * The workspace: what is on screen, as state rather than as a URL.
 *
 * This is the inversion the whole pane system rests on. Before it, the active
 * conversation was `page.params.id` — which meant changing conversations was a
 * `goto()`, which ran a server load, which landed *after* whatever animation
 * had already finished, and reshuffled the transcript underneath it. A gesture
 * needs an answer in the same frame the finger moves; a router cannot give one.
 *
 * So the tree below is the truth, and the URL is a projection of it written
 * with `pushState` — shallow, no load, no `page.data` change. Nothing on the
 * render path reads the URL back. A deep link still works, because the URL is
 * read exactly once per real navigation to seed this store, and never again.
 *
 * Phase 1 runs the tree in its degenerate shape: one leaf, whose tab list is
 * still owned by `workingSet`. The node types are the finished ones so the
 * grid can grow into them without a rewrite; only the ownership of `tabs`
 * moves later.
