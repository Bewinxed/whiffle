/**
 * The rebuild scheduler: how several transcripts share one screen.
 *
 * A transcript that nobody is looking at reads its session only when its
 * turn comes round here, at the slow tier (the freeze in `Transcript.svelte`
 * holds between turns). A transcript the reader IS looking at rebuilds its
 * rows on every streamed frame, which is what makes a live turn feel live.
 * The grid introduces a third case: a pane that is genuinely on screen but is
 * not the one being worked in.
 *
 * Rebuilding those the same way the focused pane is rebuilt does not scale.
 * The measured cost of one large transcript's rebuild is ~3.6ms — 1.09s of
 * script across 300 streamed frames, the number recorded in Transcript's own
 * freeze comment. Four visible panes reacting to their own streams would put
 * roughly 14ms of row-building inside single frames, which is a dropped frame
 * every time two of them are busy at once.
 *
 * So the unfocused ones take turns. One timer wakes on a fixed cadence and
 * bumps AT MOST ONE registrant, round-robin, and only if that pane's session
 * actually changed since it last built. The cost is therefore bounded by the
 * cadence rather than by how many panes are open or how fast their agents are
 * talking: one ~3.6ms rebuild per slot, whatever else is happening.
 *
 * What deliberately does NOT wait for a turn: anything the reader needs to
 * notice. A parked permission renders from `session.pending` outside the
 * frozen region, so an unfocused pane's "needs you" is never a quarter-second
 * late. This schedules the transcript, not the alarm.
 *
 * Why not requestAnimationFrame: rAF bounds WHEN work runs, not how much of
 * it. Four dirty panes in one frame is the same spike, merely aligned to it.
 * Why not requestIdleCallback: it starves under sustained streaming, which is
 * exactly the case that needs bounding. Why not a cheaper tail-only build for
 * unfocused panes: a second row builder has to agree with the real one about
 * keys, or settle-continuity and prepend detection break in ways that only
 * show up as a flicker much later.
